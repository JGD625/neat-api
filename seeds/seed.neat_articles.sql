It''s ok, I did too, the first time I tried it.  But it doesn''t have to be as frightening as it sounds! Scotch is often thought of as only smokey, earthy, or bitter, but it can be a truly unique experience if you can learn to appreciate all its complexities.  I suggest trying a few out at bars before bringing a bottle home, as a good scotch can be quite expensive. Scotch is often aged for quite a long time, so a lot of love goes into the bottle before it makes it to you.  If you have a bar tender you trust, you can let them know the qualities you enjoy in a drink and have them prepare a list for you. Otherwise, commit to ordering a small pour of scotch when you can, at the least once a month. I would even suggest a diary to take notes so you can compare with that trusty bartender!'),

Having a proper one in an Irish bar can really take your mind of the snow and wind, and warm you in your heart and in your belly. But what about when it is sweltering in mid-summer? Thanks to the popularity of the frappe, a good Irish Coffee is around every season now! And, with a little prep, it could not be easier.  Simply pour a bit of coffee into ice molds (especially easy if you have a bit extra left in the morning). Add your frozen coffee cubes, a bit of sweet cream, and a shot (or two!) of a good solid Irish variety, such as The Dead Rabbit Whisky, and blend into the perfect frappe. Top with a bit of whipped cream and shaved chocolate for the perfect treat.'),

As you build a relationship with the staff and other regulars, you can find out about more expressions to try. Sometimes, with trust and time, you can even get your hands on harder to find bottles. Bars and cafes often have better distribution centers to work with than the average joe, and a solid bar keep can introduce you to some brands you never even knew you were missing.'),

You do not need a large bar or only top shelf expressions to really make an impact. Keep your budget in mind, and choose a mid-level bourbon that is not too sweet, a crisp white liquor like a vodka or a gin, and one liquer such as Cassis or a coffee flavor. With one juice, one cola, and one dry mixer like club soda, a little ice and one or two garnishes, you can really push a small bar a long way.');
